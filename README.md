#Radioactivity

Radioactivity is a mod for Kerbal Space Program that attempts to bring a rough model of semi-realistic radiation to KSP. The system computes radiation paths from sources of radiation on a vessel to sensitive objects and applies various effects to the latter. Distance and attenuation are taken into effect, so vessels must be designed to protect their crew and payload from nasty radioactive parts.

This wiki should give some information about the basics of the mod, the concepts behind the mod, and also contains some information for modders that want to use it.

## Current Features
* Robust ray-based model for emission of radiation from point sources
* Radiation effects for Kerbals, science instruments and probe cores
* Tracking of lifetime doses and health of Kerbals
* Overlays in flight and VAB for planning vessel design

## Planned Features
* Solar and planetary radiation modeling
* Shadow shield and shielding panel parts
* Storm cellar part(s)
* Medical lab part
* Geiger counter science experiment part

## Limitations
* Only one energy level and type of radiation is modeled (500keV gamma)
* No modeling of material neutron activation or scattering
* Ray-based model occlusion does not account for volume emitters or volume absorbers (points).
