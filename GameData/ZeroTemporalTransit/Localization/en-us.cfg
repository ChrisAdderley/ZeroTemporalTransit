    #LOC_ZTT_ztt-drive-25-1_description = Primary core of a Zero Temporal Transit drive. Can open a spherical wormhole to a target location in space, whose size is controlled by the amount of energy patterning cells on a ship. The drive only alters the ship's position and does not affect its velocity, so beware. Deep gravity wells and long jumps throw off targeting and increase energy usage.
